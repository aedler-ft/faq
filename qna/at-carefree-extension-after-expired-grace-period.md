## Answer

The subscription for digital products offered by fiskaltrust has a validity date, which, upon expiration, enters a 3-months-long grace period. To ensure the continuity of service, the subscription must be extended before the end of the grace period. After the expiration of the grace period it will not be possible to extend the subscription via portal, and a request for assistance will have to be placed with the fiskaltrust Support.

**What will happen next:** After receiving the request for assistance, the fiskaltrust Support will manually update the expiration details of the subscription for a limited time, thus allowing the Customer to process the extension of the subscription in the usual way via the fiskaltrust portal. Upon the successful extension, the fiskaltrust Support will update the subscription details accordingly to match the original purchase and expiration dates.
